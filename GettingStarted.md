# Getting Started #
We already wrote a getting started section on [reference documentation](http://nibirumobile.googlecode.com/git/main/docs/Nibiru_Mobile_Reference_en.pdf). In order to avoid documentation duplication, we aren't going to copy it here. So, please read the section 3 in part I of such document.

Also, part II, which explains typical project structure can be helpful.

# Demos #
Too lazy to download the framework and try to run it? Dont' worry. Here you have some (silly) online demos:

  * [MGWT demo](http://servidor.oxen.com.ar/ar.com.oxen.nibiru.mobile.sample.mgwt/)
  * [SmartGWT Mobile demo](http://servidor.oxen.com.ar/ar.com.oxen.nibiru.mobile.sample.smartgwt/)
