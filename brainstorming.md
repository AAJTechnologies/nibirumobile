# Introduction #

The objective of this page is discussing ideas for future framework improvements


# Ideas #

  * Provide iOS support by creating native iOS views as PhoneGap plugins (this could be too complex).
  * Support key-based internationalization (for example,  using ConstantsWithLookup in GWT).
  * Provide customizable data in user profile.
  * Licensing module (using Oxen Java Commons licensing).
  * Server-client state synchronization.
  * Module for exposing Nibiru services as Android services in order to reuse them from different applications.


Any idea/constructive criticism is welcome!
